## Relevant Rules

+ A document has only one first level title, followed by the "path" of documentation.
+ The members who have the get / set blessing are called "properties".
+ Enumerations are described by table.
+ A relatively large class is divided into properties, member functions, public members, protection members, static public members and related non-members. Some may also describe separately the decorator functions they use.
+ The inheritance relationship of core class should be clarified.
+ For the time being, both type and interface are described in terms of class.
